# education_stats

A small shiny app that makes a subset of World Development Indicators (WDI) related to education and provided by the World Bank readily available. Users can build simple scatter and time series plots from scratch to analyse the relationships between chosen variables. See [here](https://patalt.shinyapps.io/education_in_numbers/) for a live version of the app.
